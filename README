About Program: This script runs in the background as a daemon and plays
               a warning sound and displays a popup as soon as the
               battery level falls below the defined threshold.

               Add this script to the startup applications and it will
               work just fine.

               Default voice:     female (Acceptable value: male, female)
               Default threshold: 25%    (Acceptable value: 0-100%)

               To change these values, edit the variables at the beginning
               of the script.

               To stop the script, simply kill it from the terminal.

               Make sure that the 4 files are always present in the folder:
               warning_male.wav,
               warning_female.wav,
               README & the script itself.
